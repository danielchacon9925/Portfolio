# SQL Fundamentals Challenge

This project demonstrates a series of SQL queries designed to practice **data exploration and analysis** on a sample movie rental database.  
The queries focus on real-world style questions using operations such as filtering, pattern matching, aggregation, and retrieving distinct values.

---

## Project Overview
The goal of this challenge is to apply SQL fundamentals to answer practical business questions.  
By querying tables such as **payment**, **actor**, **address**, and **film**, we can extract meaningful insights related to transactions, customers, and movie details.

This type of project is useful for:
- Practicing SQL for assessments  
- Database querying  
- Understanding how to retrieve and analyze relational data  

---

## Key learnings

- **Aggregation**: Using functions like COUNT() to summarize data.

- **Filtering**: Applying conditions with WHERE and ranges with BETWEEN.

- **Pattern Matching**: Using LIKE with wildcards for flexible text search.

- **Distinct Values**: Retrieving unique records with DISTINCT.

- **Combining Conditions**: Using logical operators (AND) to refine queries.

- **Practical Application**: Solving real-world questions on customers, transactions, and films.

## How to Run

- 1. Load the database into PostgreSQL.

- 2. Open your SQL client or command-line tool.

- 3. Copy and paste the queries to execute them.

- 4. Review the results to analyze customer, transaction, and film insights.

# SQL GROUP BY Challenge

This project demonstrates a series of SQL queries designed to practice data exploration and analysis on a sample movie rental database. 
The queries focus on answering real-world questions using operations such as filtering, pattern matching, aggregation, and retrieving distinct values.
---

## Project Overview
The goal of this challenge is to apply SQL fundamentals to answer practical business questions.  
By querying tables such as **payment**, **actor**, **address**, and **film**, we can extract meaningful insights related to transactions, customers, and movie details.

## Key learnings

- **Aggregation**: Using functions like COUNT() and SUM() to summarize data.

- **Filtering**: Applying conditions with WHERE and HAVING to narrow down results. WHERE filters individual rows, while HAVING filters grouped data.

- **Pattern Matching**: Using LIKE with wildcards (%) to search for flexible text patterns.

- **Sorting and Limiting use**: Using ORDER BY and LIMIT to organize and restrict the number of results.

- **Combining Conditions**: Using logical operators (AND) to refine queries.

- **Practical Application**: Solving real-world questions on customers, transactions, and films.

# Daniel Chac√≥n Mora - Code Portfolio  

Welcome to my code portfolio! This repository showcases projects I've developed in C, C++, Python, Assembly, and Verilog. My main areas of expertise include embedded software development and digital design, making this portfolio relevant for roles in Embedded Software Engineering, SoC Design, and Physical Design Engineering.  

## Key Areas of Focus  

- **Embedded Software Development (C, C++, Assembly)**  
  - Low-level programming for microcontrollers and embedded systems.  
  - Device drivers, real-time systems, and hardware-software interaction.  

- **Digital Design & SoC Development (Verilog, FPGA)**  
  - RTL design and simulation for ASIC/FPGA implementations.  
  - Digital logic design, synthesis, and timing analysis.

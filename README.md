# Daniel ChacÃ³n Mora - Code Portfolio  

Welcome to my code portfolio! This repository showcases projects I've developed in C, C++, Python, Assembly, and Verilog. My main areas of expertise include embedded software development and digital design, making this portfolio relevant for roles in Embedded Software Engineering, SoC Design, and Physical Design Engineering.  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Areas of Focus  

- **Embedded Software Development (C, C++, Assembly)**  
  - Low-level programming for microcontrollers and embedded systems.  
  - Device drivers, real-time systems, and hardware-software interaction.  

- **Digital Design & SoC Development (Verilog, FPGA)**  
  - RTL design and simulation for ASIC/FPGA implementations.  
  - Digital logic design, synthesis, and timing analysis.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Categories  

### ðŸ”¹ Embedded Systems (C, C++, Assembly)  
- **[Project Name]** â€“ Brief description of what it does and its relevance.  
- **[Project Name]** â€“ Another project description.  

### ðŸ”¹ Digital Design & Hardware Acceleration (Verilog)  
- **[Project Name]** â€“ Description (e.g., an ALU, a custom processor, an FPGA project).  
- **[Project Name]** â€“ Another Verilog project description.  

### ðŸ”¹ Scripting & Tooling (Python)  
- **[Project Name]** â€“ Python scripts or automation tools.  
- **[Project Name]** â€“ Another Python-related project.  

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Repository  

Each project has its own folder with a `README.md` explaining its functionality, setup instructions, and relevant documentation.

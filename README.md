# Daniel Chacón Mora - Code Portfolio  

Welcome to my code portfolio! This repository showcases projects I've developed in C, C++, Python, Assembly, and Verilog. My main areas of expertise include embedded software development and digital design, making this portfolio relevant for roles in Embedded Software Engineering, SoC Design, and Physical Design Engineering.  

## Key Areas of Focus  

- **Embedded Software Development (C, C++, Assembly)**  
  - Low-level programming for microcontrollers and embedded systems.  
  - Device drivers, real-time systems, and hardware-software interaction.  

- **Digital Design & SoC Development (Verilog, FPGA)**  
  - RTL design and simulation for ASIC/FPGA implementations.  
  - Digital logic design, synthesis, and timing analysis.  


## Project Categories  

###  Embedded Systems (C, C++, Assembly)  
**Artimeticos_basicos** – Implementation of nested loops, arrays, and matrix manipulation to perform fundamental arithmetic operations. 
- **Libreria_llamada_main** – Demonstrates the creation of libraries using header and implementation files, along with array generation and pointer manipulation in a main file..  
- **Microcontroladores** – Embedded C code for real-world applications such as a washing machine controller, seismograph simulation, and tombola (bingo spinning wheel) on platforms like Arduino, STM32, and PIC microcontrollers..

  
### Digital Design & Hardware Acceleration (Verilog)  
- **4bits_shiftregister** – 4-bit shift register with RTL design, DUT, and testbench. Demonstrates circular rotation (left and right) and shift operations (left and right), along with edge-triggered clocking and reset mechanisms.
- **MDIO_transaction_generator** – Verilog-based MDIO (Management Data Input/Output) transaction generator. Includes RTL design for MDIO frame generation, DUT for protocol simulation, and a testbench for validating read/write operations and error handling.   
- **Serial_paralel_converter** – Module for converting serial data streams into parallel outputs. Features RTL design for bit-level synchronization, DUT for functional verification, and a testbench to validate timing and data integrity.
- **UART_Transfer** – A complete UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) implementation in Verilog. Includes RTL design for baud rate generation, start/stop bit handling, and data framing, along with a DUT and testbench for simulating full-duplex communication.

### Scripting & Tooling (Python) 
 - **ADAS Sensor Data Processor** – Python-based tool for embedded signal processing pipeline for automotive systems. Filters sensor outliers (±3σ) and computes moving averages to smooth noisy measurements from LiDAR/RADAR systems. Demonstrates NumPy-based statistical analysis and real-time data conditioning for safety-critical applications. 
- **Calculadora_Transformadores** – Python-based tool for calculating transformer parameters, such as turns ratio, voltage, and current. Ideal for electrical engineering applications, it provides quick and accurate computations for transformer design and analysis.  
- **Consumo_API_ICE** – Script that interacts with the ICE (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad) API to fetch and analyze energy consumption data. Useful for monitoring and visualizing energy usage patterns..  
- **GDS_LOGIC_CELLS_EXTRACTER** – Python utility for extracting and analyzing logic cells from GDSII files. Designed for VLSI and digital design workflows, it aids in parsing and processing layout data for integrated circuits  
- **Implementacion_Optimizacion_Benchmarks_OpenLane** – VLSI project using OpenLane to explore the impact of various optimization configurations (synthesis, floorplanning, and placement) on power and area. Python scripts automate the execution of random configurations, extract data, and organize results into DataFrames for analysis. The project also generates GDSII files during signoff for further physical design analysis. 
- **Listas_dataframes** – Advanced data manipulation techniques using lists and Pandas DataFrames. Includes examples of filtering, sorting, and transforming datasets for data analysis tasks.  
- **Microcontroladores** – Dashboard for visualizing and analyzing results from microcontroller simulations and experiments. Provides an intuitive interface to display performance metrics, sensor data, and system behavior for embedded systems projects.. 
- **Perceptron_Predictor** – Perceptron-based machine learning model for binary classification. Demonstrates training, testing, and prediction using a simple neural network..
- **Poliformismo_Agencia_Bancaria** – project showcasing object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, particularly polymorphism, through a simulated banking agency system. Includes classes for accounts, transactions, and customer management.
- **Simulador_CACHE** – Models cache behavior, including hit/miss rates, replacement policies, and cache hierarchy, for educational and research purposes.
